### **Setup Instructions**

#### **1. Install Flutter**  
Ensure you have Flutter installed on your machine. You can follow the [official Flutter installation guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).  

#### **2. Get an OpenWeatherMap API Key**  
1. Go to the [OpenWeatherMap website](https://openweathermap.org/api).  
2. Sign up or log in to your account.  
3. Navigate to the API section, and create a new API key.  

#### **3. Configure the API Key**  
1. Create a directory named `config` in the root of your project.  
2. Inside the `config` directory, create a file named `app_config.json`.  
3. Add your API key to the file in the following format:  
   ```json
   {
       "API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
   }
   ```  

4. Add the `config` directory to your `pubspec.yaml` file under the `flutter` section:  
   ```yaml
   flutter:
     assets:
       - config/app_config.json
   ```

5. Run the following command to fetch dependencies and apply changes:
